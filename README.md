# TurkTelekom TP-Link Modems - Authenticated Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

"A Auth-based RCE vulnerability is a security flaw that allows a user with limited access to a system or application to execute code beyond their permissions. These vulnerabilities enable an attacker to execute any code they want on a remote server. Such vulnerabilities typically arise due to a lack of security controls in software, inadequate input validation, or poor system configuration.

In TP-Link TÃ¼rktelekom modems, after logging in, a command injection vulnerability has been identified in the "connName" input field, which is an Interface parameter in the IP & Domain Test module under the System Tools Menu, using the expressions "$(command)" and "\`command\`" .
